### Talos

A 3D game engine emphasizing efficient architecture, with low coupling and high cohesion.

* Hierarchical design to minimize complexity, control flow, and data flow
* Scalable networked multiplayer with high-latency mitigation using client-side prediction (RakNet)
* Usage of design patterns: flyweight, observer, object pool, chain of responsibility, command, factory
* Entity-component system for easy customization of world objects
* Frame-rate independence without the need for delta time values in every system
* Ogre3D integration with NVIDIA PhysX - static/dynamic object support
* Kinematic character controller for world navigation (using NVIDIA PhysX)
* Fundamental first-person shooter mechanics; player-world interaction
* UI implementation using CEGUI, chat support for multiplayer
* Gamepad input support for first-person camera
* 3D sound support using irrKlang
